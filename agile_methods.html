<h1>Agile Software Exploration</h1>
  		Words taken from the most popular sources for each methodology, and "normalized".

   	<div id="readme" >
  		<h2>Methodology</h2>
  		<p>Went to the most popular sources for the various agile software methodologies and found what was 
  		(in my opinion), the canonical summary of it. For example, the Agile Manifesto has a one page values
  		page and 12 principals. Some were less obvious, and I identified a chapter on lean software as my source.</p>
  		
  		<p>After identifying the source, I indexed the "concepts". There's lots of squishyness here, and lots of
  		room for error and opinions to sneak in. I repeated my process on XP and agile, and got subtly different results.
  		Not great from a scientific method point of view, but let's call it "experimental error".</p>
  		
  		<p>After identifying the concepts, I went through a process of "normalizing" those into what seemed like 
  		the same concept. Again, lots of room for error. Are "sprints" the same as "iterations"? Well, I had to
  		make lots of calls.</p>
  		
  		<p>Finally, I wanted to visualize this data. I looked at different options, rejected quite a few. MindMaps are
  		neat, but don't really promote the comparison I wanted. Any sort of graph didn't work well. I finally settled
  		upon the visual theseaurus metaphor. I actually rejected this as "flashy" and unnecessary use of software when
  	    I first saw it, but the more I thought about it, the better fit it was.</p>
  	    
  	    <p>It was then a matter of finding a technology that would do this. I looked at using Processing (a Java variant
  	    that lots of people are using to build visualizations), but thought wanted something as light weight as possible.
  	    So Google to the rescue, and I found someone who had experimented with "force directed graphs" in Javascript. 
  	    I grabbed the code, and threw my data in it.</p>
  	    
  	    <p>There was a little engineering in how I integrated this. I knew the spreadsheet would update (and I wanted to add
  	    more methodologies potentially), so I wrote a Ruby script that takes the spreadsheet and generates Javascript. But
  	    I wanted some leeway with the Javascript to try different approaches, so I had the Ruby script generate 
  	    data structure. And I wrote simple Javascript that was driven off of these structures.</p>
